uprocess
========

A simple preprocessor written in javascript, supports include, define, ifdef and ifndef.

It takes a file and an object with defines (values are ignored) and returns the processed file. 

It can be used to make a build script which creates indivdualised builds of one software, it can also be used to just include files and control that they are only included once.

COMING SOON!!
